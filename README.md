# Wardrobify

Team:

* Jonathan Blazer - Shoes

## Design

React App:
    NAV bar will have 5 links: Home, Shoelist, HatList, CreateShoe, CreateHat
    Each item on each list will have a "delete" button next to it.
        after clicking the Delete button, list should re-render without that item.
    List view should use Bootstrap CARDS
